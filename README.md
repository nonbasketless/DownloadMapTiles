This is a small Python (3.x) which downloads map tiles from a base URL, and saves them locally (perhaps for offline use). You can edit the py file and add new sources as you please, but be sure you're not violating terms of service from the provider.

Run DownloadMapTiles.py and follow the prompt to select a source.

Also included is a map.html, which can view downloaded tiles. It will require OpenLayers and a few other things - open the file to see what's missing.

Enjoy!
